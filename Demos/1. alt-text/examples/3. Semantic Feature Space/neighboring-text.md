Before Image:
Consider the words "man", "woman", "boy", and "girl". Two of them refer to males, and two to females. Also, two of them refer to adults, and two to children. We can plot these worlds as points on a graph where the x axis axis represents gender and the y axis represents age:

After Image:
 Gender and age are called semantic features: they represent part of the meaning of each word. If we associate a numerical scale with each feature, then we can assign coordinates to each word:
Word Coordinates
	Gender	Age	
man 	[ 	1, 	7 	]
woman 	[ 	9, 	7 	]
boy 	[ 	1, 	2 	]
girl 	[ 	9, 	2 	]
