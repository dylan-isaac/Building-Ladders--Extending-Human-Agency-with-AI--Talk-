<surrounding_content>
Before Image:
Consider the words "man", "woman", "boy", and "girl". Two of them refer to males, and two to females. Also, two of them refer to adults, and two to children. We can plot these worlds as points on a graph where the x axis axis represents gender and the y axis represents age:

After Image:
 Gender and age are called semantic features: they represent part of the meaning of each word. If we associate a numerical scale with each feature, then we can assign coordinates to each word:
Word Coordinates
	Gender	Age	
man 	[ 	1, 	7 	]
woman 	[ 	9, 	7 	]
boy 	[ 	1, 	2 	]
girl 	[ 	9, 	2 	]
</surrounding_content>

<image>
[The raw image file called `image.*` attached to the chat message]
</image>

<image-on-page>
[The image file called `image-on-page.*` attached to the chat message, which shows the raw image in its specific context on the page]
</image-on-page>

### **Procedure - Follow Each Step:**

**Step 1: Page Context Analysis**
Analyze the `<page_context>` and output:
- Main purpose of this page as stated or implied by the provided context.
- Core themes being discussed based on the content provided.
- Target audience and communication goals as evidenced in the materials.

**Step 2: Surrounding Content Analysis**
Analyze the `<surrounding_content>` and the visual placement of the `<image>` within `<image-on-page>`. Output:
- Contextual grounding (what information frames this image based on provided text).
- Tone and style of the content as written.
- Specific topic being discussed in this section according to the text.
- Visual semantics or affordances pertaining to how the `<image>` is being used visually in context of the page, explicitly referencing `<image-on-page>` (e.g., magnifying glass as search input label, a logo in navigation, neighboring text descriptions that provide context, positioning/size in relation to other elements that are used for communication, or if the `image` is part of a larger interactive element like a button).
- **Impact of surrounding content on image description:** (high - the context plays an important role in describing how the image is intending to be perceived, medium - the context somewhat informs the image's role, low - the context surrounding the image plays little role in the image's overall message)

**Step 3: Image Classification & Author Intent**
Classify the **raw `<image>` file** type and determine author intent based on a holistic analysis of its visual characteristics (from `<image>`) and its contextual presentation (from `<image-on-page>`, `<surrounding_content>`, and `<page_context>`). Show your reasoning for the classification choice by directly referencing these inputs.

- **Image Type (Select one and provide detection rationale):**
    - **Decorative Image:**
        - **Detection Rules:** Adds visual appeal but conveys no meaningful information relevant to the content independently; if removed, the user wouldn't lose any understanding because its meaning is fully conveyed by accompanying text or other elements; often consists of spacers, borders, abstract background images, or icons that are redundant/next to visible text. **Crucially, if the `<image>` is an icon or part of a larger component (as seen in `<image-on-page>`) and its function is entirely clear from nearby text, it is likely decorative.**
        - **Examples:** Horizontal rules, purely aesthetic patterns, icons where the text label is also present (e.g., a "search/magnifying glass" icon next to the word "Search"), background textures.
    - **Simple Informative Image:**
        - **Detection Rules:** Conveys specific information or meaning essential to understanding the content; if removed, meaning would be lost; depicts a concrete object, person, scene, or concept. Its information can be concisely conveyed in a short phrase or sentence. **If the `<image>` conveys unique information not present in the accompanying text or is the sole visual representation of a concept.**
        - **Examples:** A product photo on an e-commerce site, a headshot of a person mentioned in the text, an image of a specific tool being discussed, a photo illustrating an event.
    - **Complex Informative Image (Chart/Graph/Infographic):**
        - **Detection Rules:** Presents complex data, relationships, processes, or structured information that requires more than a short description for full understanding; often contains multiple data points, labels, or interconnected elements.
        - **Examples:** Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, flow diagrams, maps conveying specific data, detailed infographics, schematics, complex diagrams.

- **Author Intent:** Why this specific `<image>` was chosen for this context, based on visual evidence from `<image>` and its placement/function within `<image-on-page>` and `<surrounding_content>`. Describe what the image appears intended to communicate.
- **Key Information:** What the `<image>` visually communicates to users. Describe what is shown in the `<image>`. Explain *how* the **raw `<image>` file** (e.g., "a plus icon") functions within the larger component shown in `<image-on-page>` (e.g., "the button labeled 'Create'"). **Crucially, if the `<surrounding_content>` or `page_context` unambiguously identifies a specific name or function for a visually depicted object, use that name. Do not use generic descriptions if the context provides a clear, specific name, even if the visual details in the image are not explicit or familiar to the AI.**
- **Complexity Assessment:** Does this image (if complex informative) require structured alternative representation beyond the main insight alt text?

**Step 4: Alt Text Generation**
Create appropriate alt text for the **raw `<image>` file** based on its classification in Step 3 and the comprehensive context from Steps 1 and 2.

*Naming Guidelines:*
- If the page or section text (from `<page_context>` or `<surrounding_content>`) refers to a subject, and the `<image>` depicts an object matching that context, you may use that name in the alt text.
- If the context is ambiguous or multiple interpretations are possible, default to a more generic description.
- Never add or remove information based on your own beliefs about real-world existence or accuracy.

- **For Simple Informative Images:** Generate concise alt text (maximum 2 sentences, 140 characters preferred) that captures the visual content and any text visible *within the image itself*.
- **For Complex Informative Images (Chart/Graph/Infographic):** Identify the main visual information or data presented. Format this as a concise alt text (maximum 2 sentences, 140 characters preferred) describing what is shown. Append the exact message: "A more complete alternative [data table/structured breakdown - choose based on content] exists below this image."
- **For Decorative Images:** Provide an empty alt text: `""`.

**Rationale for Alt Text Decision:** Explicitly explain *why* the chosen alt text (or empty string) is appropriate for the **raw `<image>` file**, directly referencing:
1.  The image type determined in Step 3.
2.  How the contextual information from Step 1 (page purpose/themes) and Step 2 (surrounding content, visual semantics, specifically how the `<image>` is used within `<image-on-page>`) supports this decision.
3.  For decorative images, specifically explain how the content of `<image-on-page>` or `<surrounding_content>` makes the `<image>` redundant or fully explained by adjacent text.

**Step 5: Structured Alternative (if applicable)**
If Step 3 identified a Complex Informative Image, create a structured accessible alternative describing the visual information presented.
- **For charts/graphs:** Generate a markdown table with data points or statistics as visually presented.
- **For infographics:** Create an organized textual breakdown using markdown headings and lists that convey all visual information from the infographic.
- **Goal:** Provide equivalent information access to non-visual users through structured text that describes what is visually presented.
