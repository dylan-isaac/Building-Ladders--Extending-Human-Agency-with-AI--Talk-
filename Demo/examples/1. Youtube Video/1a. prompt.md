### **Procedure - Follow Each Step:**

**Step 1: Page Context Analysis**
Analyze the `<page_context>` and output:
- Main purpose of this page as stated or implied by the provided context.
- Core themes being discussed based on the content provided.
- Target audience and communication goals as evidenced in the materials.

**Step 2: Surrounding Content Analysis**
Analyze the `<surrounding_content>` and the visual placement of the `<image>` within `<image-on-page>`. Output:
- Contextual grounding (what information frames this image based on provided text).
- Tone and style of the content as written.
- Specific topic being discussed in this section according to the text.
- Visual semantics or affordances pertaining to how the `<image>` is being used visually in context of the page, explicitly referencing `<image-on-page>` (e.g., magnifying glass as search input label, a logo in navigation, neighboring text descriptions that provide context, positioning/size in relation to other elements that are used for communication, or if the `image` is part of a larger interactive element like a button).
- **Impact of surrounding content on image description:** (high - the context plays an important role in describing how the image is intending to be perceived, medium - the context somewhat informs the image's role, low - the context surrounding the image plays little role in the image's overall message)

**Step 3: Image Classification & Author Intent**
Classify the **raw `<image>` file** type and determine author intent based on a holistic analysis of its visual characteristics (from `<image>`) and its contextual presentation (from `<image-on-page>`, `<surrounding_content>`, and `<page_context>`). Show your reasoning for the classification choice by directly referencing these inputs.

- **Image Type (Select one and provide detection rationale):**
    - **Decorative Image:**
        - **Detection Rules:** Adds visual appeal but conveys no meaningful information relevant to the content independently; if removed, the user wouldn't lose any understanding because its meaning is fully conveyed by accompanying text or other elements; often consists of spacers, borders, abstract background images, or icons that are redundant/next to visible text. **Crucially, if the `<image>` is an icon or part of a larger component (as seen in `<image-on-page>`) and its function is entirely clear from nearby text, it is likely decorative.**
        - **Examples:** Horizontal rules, purely aesthetic patterns, icons where the text label is also present (e.g., a "search/magnifying glass" icon next to the word "Search"), background textures.
    - **Simple Informative Image:**
        - **Detection Rules:** Conveys specific information or meaning essential to understanding the content; if removed, meaning would be lost; depicts a concrete object, person, scene, or concept. Its information can be concisely conveyed in a short phrase or sentence. **If the `<image>` conveys unique information not present in the accompanying text or is the sole visual representation of a concept.**
        - **Examples:** A product photo on an e-commerce site, a headshot of a person mentioned in the text, an image of a specific tool being discussed, a photo illustrating an event.
    - **Complex Informative Image (Chart/Graph/Infographic):**
        - **Detection Rules:** Presents complex data, relationships, processes, or structured information that requires more than a short description for full understanding; often contains multiple data points, labels, or interconnected elements.
        - **Examples:** Bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, scatter plots, flow diagrams, maps conveying specific data, detailed infographics, schematics, complex diagrams.

- **Author Intent:** Why this specific `<image>` was chosen for this context, based on visual evidence from `<image>` and its placement/function within `<image-on-page>` and `<surrounding_content>`. Describe what the image appears intended to communicate.
- **Key Information:** What the `<image>` visually communicates to users. Describe what is shown in the `<image>`. Explain *how* the **raw `<image>` file** (e.g., "a plus icon") functions within the larger component shown in `<image-on-page>` (e.g., "the button labeled 'Create'"). **Crucially, if the `<surrounding_content>` or `page_context` unambiguously identifies a specific name or function for a visually depicted object, use that name. Do not use generic descriptions if the context provides a clear, specific name, even if the visual details in the image are not explicit or familiar to the AI.**
- **Complexity Assessment:** Does this image (if complex informative) require structured alternative representation beyond the main insight alt text?

**Step 4: Alt Text Generation**
Create appropriate alt text for the **raw `<image>` file** based on its classification in Step 3 and the comprehensive context from Steps 1 and 2.

*Naming Guidelines:*
- If the page or section text (from `<page_context>` or `<surrounding_content>`) refers to a subject, and the `<image>` depicts an object matching that context, you may use that name in the alt text.
- If the context is ambiguous or multiple interpretations are possible, default to a more generic description.
- Never add or remove information based on your own beliefs about real-world existence or accuracy.

- **For Simple Informative Images:** Generate concise alt text (maximum 2 sentences, 140 characters preferred) that captures the visual content and any text visible *within the image itself*.
- **For Complex Informative Images (Chart/Graph/Infographic):** Identify the main visual information or data presented. Format this as a concise alt text (maximum 2 sentences, 140 characters preferred) describing what is shown. Append the exact message: "A more complete alternative [data table/structured breakdown - choose based on content] exists below this image."
- **For Decorative Images:** Provide an empty alt text: `""`.

**Rationale for Alt Text Decision:** Explicitly explain *why* the chosen alt text (or empty string) is appropriate for the **raw `<image>` file**, directly referencing:
1.  The image type determined in Step 3.
2.  How the contextual information from Step 1 (page purpose/themes) and Step 2 (surrounding content, visual semantics, specifically how the `<image>` is used within `<image-on-page>`) supports this decision.
3.  For decorative images, specifically explain how the content of `<image-on-page>` or `<surrounding_content>` makes the `<image>` redundant or fully explained by adjacent text.

**Step 5: Structured Alternative (if applicable)**
If Step 3 identified a Complex Informative Image, create a structured accessible alternative describing the visual information presented.
- **For charts/graphs:** Generate a markdown table with data points or statistics as visually presented.
- **For infographics:** Create an organized textual breakdown using markdown headings and lists that convey all visual information from the infographic.
- **Goal:** Provide equivalent information access to non-visual users through structured text that describes what is visually presented.
