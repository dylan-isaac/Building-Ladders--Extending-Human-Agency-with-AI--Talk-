## Step 1: Page Context Analysis

**Main purpose:** This page serves as an educational tutorial on word embeddings, specifically demonstrating how words can be represented as numerical vectors in semantic feature spaces for natural language processing and machine learning applications.

**Core themes:** The page focuses on semantic feature representation, vector mathematics applied to language, word relationships through numerical coordinates, and the foundational concepts behind word embedding technologies.

**Target audience:** Students, researchers, or practitioners learning about computational linguistics, NLP, or machine learning who need to understand how semantic meaning can be quantified and manipulated mathematically.

## Step 2: Surrounding Content Analysis

**Contextual grounding:** The image is introduced by text explaining that "man", "woman", "boy", and "girl" can be plotted as points on a graph where the x-axis represents gender and y-axis represents age. This directly sets up the visual representation that follows.

**Tone and style:** Academic and instructional, using clear, methodical explanations with concrete examples to build understanding progressively.

**Specific topic:** This section introduces the concept of semantic feature spaces by demonstrating how word meanings can be decomposed into measurable dimensions (gender and age) and plotted graphically.

**Visual semantics:** The `<image-on-page>` shows the graph is positioned as the primary visual demonstration of the concept being explained. It appears as a standalone educational diagram that illustrates the theoretical concept described in the preceding text. The graph serves as the visual proof-of-concept for the semantic feature space theory.

**Impact of surrounding content on image description:** **High** - The surrounding content is essential for understanding that this graph specifically represents the four words (man, woman, boy, girl) plotted according to gender and age dimensions, and that this is demonstrating semantic feature space concepts.

## Step 3: Image Classification & Author Intent

**Image Type:** Complex Informative Image (Chart/Graph/Infographic)

**Detection rationale:** The `<image>` is a scatter plot with labeled axes (Gender, Age), gridlines, specific data points with word labels, and numerical scales. It presents structured data relationships that require more than a short description for full understanding. The graph contains multiple interconnected elements (axes, scales, plotted points, labels) that collectively demonstrate the semantic feature space concept.

**Author Intent:** To provide a concrete visual demonstration of how abstract semantic concepts (word meanings) can be quantified and plotted in mathematical space, making the theoretical concept of semantic feature vectors tangible and understandable.

**Key Information:** The image shows a coordinate graph with "Gender" on the x-axis (0-10 scale) and "Age" on the y-axis (0-10 scale). Four blue dots represent the words: "man" at approximately (1,7), "woman" at approximately (9,7), "boy" at approximately (1,2), and "girl" at approximately (9,2). The positioning demonstrates how semantic features can be numerically represented.

**Complexity Assessment:** Yes, this requires structured alternative representation as it contains specific coordinate data and relationships that need to be preserved for full understanding.

## Step 4: Alt Text Generation

**Alt text:** `"Scatter plot showing four words plotted by gender and age coordinates in semantic feature space. A more complete alternative data table exists below this image."`

**Rationale for Alt Text Decision:** 
1. **Image type:** As a Complex Informative Image, it requires concise alt text plus structured alternative.
2. **Contextual support:** The surrounding content from Step 2 establishes this is specifically about semantic feature space representation of the four words mentioned, and the page context from Step 1 confirms this is educational content about word embeddings.
3. **Visual function:** The `<image-on-page>` shows this graph serves as the primary visual demonstration of the concept, making it essential informative content rather than decorative.

## Step 5: Structured Alternative

| Word | Gender Coordinate | Age Coordinate | Position Description |
|------|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| man | 1 | 7 | Lower left quadrant (male adult) |
| woman | 9 | 7 | Lower right quadrant (female adult) |
| boy | 1 | 2 | Upper left quadrant (male child) |
| girl | 9 | 2 | Upper right quadrant (female child) |

**Graph Structure:**
- **X-axis:** Gender (scale 0-10, where lower values represent male, higher values represent female)
- **Y-axis:** Age (scale 0-10, where lower values represent children, higher values represent adults)
- **Data points:** Four blue dots positioned according to their semantic feature coordinates
- **Visual pattern:** The positioning creates clear clustering by both gender (left vs. right) and age (top vs. bottom), demonstrating how semantic features can be spatially represented
